# Calories Burnt Calculator

This is a project that calculates the calories burned by an individual during physical activity. The calculator takes input values for gender, age, height, weight, duration of activity, heart rate, and body temperature, and applies a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned.

The model used in this project is a combination of linear regression and XGBoost regressor algorithms. It was trained on a dataset of physical activity data and corresponding calorie burn measurements.
